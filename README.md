# EE102---Multiplayer-Pong-Game
Multiplayer Pong Game with joysticks designed using Basys3 FPGA board and Vivado VHDL language.

Hi, I'm Bertan Köfön from Bilkent University. This is my sophomore year term project for EEE102 - Introduction to Digital Circuit Design. I designed a Multiplayer Pong Game that can be played by 
2 players using 2 joysticks to move their bars on the screen. I used Vivado VHDL programming language and Basys3 FPGA board in implementation progress of VGA connection 
and the joysticks.
